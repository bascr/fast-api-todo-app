## Fast API - Todo App

This is the source code of a Todo App that I built during the 
[FastAPI - The Complete Course (Beginner + Advance) by Eric Roby](https://www.udemy.com/course/fastapi-the-complete-course)'

**FastAPI** is a Python framework to build Rest API Services. The topic
covered by the course are:

- Use of FastAPI framework to build Restful APIs and Full Stack Applications:
  - Models
  - Query and route parameters, body and form data
  - Routers
  - Swagger (OpenAPI)
  - Data Validation
- JWT, OAuth and Password Hashing  
- SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- Testing Endpoints with Postman

I prepared a docker-compose file on the psql folder to work with the Postgres database easier.
